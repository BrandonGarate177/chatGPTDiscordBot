# chatGPTDiscordBot

NOTE: this is JUST the code for the chat bot, again -> this is not hosted(only runs while you have your code running), or usable until you buy your own chat gpt API plan cause I'm not trynna pay for that, 

About the project: 
  I felt like i wanted to learn how to use API's more effectively. Im trynna knock some more stuff out using this API, maybe a chrome extension that summarizes articles at the click of a button
